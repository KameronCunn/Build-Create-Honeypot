## Build/Create A Honeypot
## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The primary objective of building a honeypot is to detect and analyze threats in a controlled environment. By luring attackers to the honeypot, security teams can study their tactics, techniques, and procedures without risking actual assets. This insight helps organizations enhance their defense mechanisms, update intrusion detection systems, and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Additionally, honeypots serve as a diversion, drawing attackers away from critical systems and providing an extra layer of security. Building a honeypot demonstrates proactive cybersecurity skills, enhances threat intelligence, and shows a commitment to improving network defenses, which employers highly value.
